======
This is a proof of concept project that was developed using [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a web framework module for Python. The project specifically demonstrates the utility of representing phylogenetic trees in a [Chado](http://www.gmod.org/wiki/Chado) database by providing the user with a rich set of data associated with each node in a tree as well as dynamicly reconstructing the multiple sequence alignment data used to generate the trees.

The components used are:
* [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Chado models](https://gist.github.com/danielecook/4494488)
* [D3](http://d3js.org/)
* [jsPhyloSVG](http://www.jsphylosvg.com/)
