=head1 Name

 gmod_load_msa.pl - Loads multiple sequence alignment data into the database.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  gmod_load_msa.pl <msa_file> [options]

  --dbname          The name of the chado database (default=chado)
  --username        The username to access the database with (default=chado)
  --password        The password to log into the database with
  --host            The host the database is on (default=localhost)
  --port            The port the database is on
  --dbid            The db_id from the db table for the db that the msa feature should have a dbxref with. This option is not mandatory.(Optional)
  --name            The value given to the name and uniquename fields of the feature for the msa (default=<msa_file>)
  --check_exists    Will use a consensus feature with the given consensus name if it exists
  --errorfile       The file that errors should be written to (defailt=gmod_load_msa_errors.txt)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The only argument to the script is the input file that contains the multiple sequence alignment. Polypeptide names in the database are same as their mRNA names. It is important that the names of sequences in input (MSA) files are exactly same as polypeptide names already present in the database. 

The --concensus_name flag is optional. This is the value given to the name and uniquename fields for the multiple sequence alignment feature. Note that the value given must not already exist in the table since it is used as the value for the features uniquename field. If the flag is not provided then the filename will be used.

The --check_exists flag should be used with caution. Before creating a new feature for the consensus, it checks to see if one already exists and uses it if it does. This can be useful if a load was cancelled partway through and not all the featureloc entries were created. Likewise, featureloc entries can be created for a consensus they don't belong to.

Note that this script requires there to be a "consensus" organism in the database. All fields of the organism should have "consensus" as their value.

Unlike the older version of this script, we are not considering _pep suffix for names and are using 'name' field instead of 'uniquename' with type_id of 'polypeptide' to distinguish them from mRNA in sql searches/select.
