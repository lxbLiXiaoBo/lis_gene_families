Scripts
=======
These are the scripts that were used in concert with those bundled with Chado.

## perl
Perl scripts that are pertinent to the LIS data loading pipeline.

## bash
Composed of loaders that call perl scripts in the pipeline iteratively on a bulk of files.

## scrap
This directory contains perl and bash scripts that were used but are not essential to the pipeline. Some are older versions of existing scripts with interesting funtionality, some have been combined, and others were quick munges. These have been included for completeness.
